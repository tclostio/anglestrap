# AngleStrap

This is meant to be a simple Angular template supporting users, profiles, and easy view components that allow for greater ease of extensibility than Plain Jane JS.

# Running the App

Make sure you have the latest version of Node:

```$xslt
npm --version
```

and install the latest version of the Angular CLI along with the Angular devkit

```$xslt
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
sudo npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular
```

After installing these components, simply

```$xslt
cd anglestrap
ng serve --open
```

And you're done.
